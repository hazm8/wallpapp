# wallpapp
A begginers attempt at a wallhaven api(ish) bash script
This started as a small script to rice my pc but evolved into a bash crash course.

Wallpapp is a bash script that collects wallpaper from wallhaven.cc and stores them locally.
I'll be concoperating this with another bash script that I use with i3 to set my desktop background.

If you want the full functionality, make sure you edit the file and add your wallhaven.cc api after you sign up.
Make sure to first make the file executable:
> chmod u+x Wallpapp.sh
